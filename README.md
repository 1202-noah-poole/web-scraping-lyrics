# Web Scraping MCR Lyrics
The main purpose of this project was to obtain data via web scraping. This was accomplished with the BeautifulSoup Python package.

This was my first time using the BeautifulSoup package. Fortunately, it was fairly easy to use and didn't take long at all to get a handle on. I am very unfamiliar with website structure, so the most difficult part of this project was the 'scavenger hunt' through the html code in search of what I was looking for. Still, I came out with much more knowledge than I thought I would obtain, and my resulting data set turned out rather nice, though unsurprisingly most of this project was just cleaning up the data!

Note that a lot of the code is commented out. This is because I wanted to show how I looked at the data, but I obviously didn't want them all to spit out every time I ran the code so I simply commented them out. 

There was also a lot more I could have done with the data I collected. There was a lot of data I didn't actually do anything with, I just wanted to practice web scraping, so all I did was create a simple visual of the most common words. 

Here is the visual, i.e. the result of the code:
